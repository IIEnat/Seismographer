# 🌍 Seismograph Visualiser - Real Time Seismic Imaging 
Seismograph Visualiser is an interactive tool that visualizes real-time seismic activity using live data feeds. Built for researchers for monitoring seismic movement, this project translates seismic signals into intuitive color-coded maps, providing a live, top-down view of ground motion as it happens.

## Key Features 
⚡ Real-time Data: Connects to seismic stations using SeedLink and processes streams via ObsPy.
🗺️ Dynamic Mapping: Visualizes ground motion on an interactive map.
🎨 Color-coded Intensity: Seismic intensity is rendered using color gradients for easy interpretation.
🔁 Live Updates: The map auto-refreshes as new seismic data arrives.
🔍 Customisable Views: Filter by station, region, or time window.
